Turducken
=========

A Turducken is a culinary monstrosity created by Americans.  To make a Turducken, you shove a chicken into the gastric bypass of a duck, and then shove the resultant duck into the gastric bypass of a turkey.

Who doesn't want meat as stuffing, right?

This repo is a temporary thing for code used at a Perl workshop.  It contains very simple first examples, as a POC.

In this case:
    - the Turkey is Perl6
    - the Duck is Perl (5)
    - the Chicken is Java

they all work, but _turducken.pl is the one turducken that so far works.
